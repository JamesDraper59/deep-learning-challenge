# Model Training Report

## Overview
### The Purpose: 
This neural network is designed to be used as a tool for a nonprofit organization for predicting applicants with high chances of success to allocate funding to in hopes of creating a better method of selection for the organization.

## Data Preprocessing
* This model is built to target the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" variable of the data frame
* The "EIN" and "NAME" Columns are dropped initially to remove any non features for the model that can't be used for training or as categorical data
* once "EIN" and "NAME" are dropped, every remaining variable in the data frame is usable as a feature for training and testing.
